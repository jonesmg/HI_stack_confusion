# HI confusion in stacking experiments

This is a collection of a few basic tools based on the paper [Jones et al. 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.455.1574J/abstract) to estimate the amount of confusion in HI spectral line stacking experiments.
The input values of the HI mass function have been updated to used the [Jones et al. 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.477....2J/abstract) values, while the 2 point correlation function is based on [Papastergis et al. 2013](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...776...43P/abstract).
This work assumes WMAP9 cosmology, however, if should be noted that no evolution in the HIMF or 2PCF are included.
